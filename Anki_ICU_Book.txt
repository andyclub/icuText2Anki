Q: The dimensions of bladder for BP measure
A:
1.  Length of bladder=0.8 x circumference of the upper arm;
2. Width of bladder = 0.4 x circumference of the upper arm
3. The bladder width should encircle half of the upper arm circumference.
	- If width of bladder is too small→false ↑BP
	- If width seems too big → It is OK.

Q: Some tips for BP measurement
A:
- When Patient are sitted, the arm and the back should be supported→ otherwise, falsely ↑BP
- Why the head of the stethoscope should not put under the cuff? b/c this create sounds during deflation.
- The rate of cuff deflation <2mmHg/sec
- In high-output Pts, the sounds continue long after cuff deflation→DBP is indetermined.
- In pregnancy, DBP=Korotcoff sounds become muffled (Phase  Ⅳ)
- In low flow state, underestimate SBP by 30mmHg in 50% Pts
- bell-shaped head of stethoscope should be used

Q: The oscillometric method for BP measure
A:
- according to the pulsatile pressure change to measure BP
- The most accurate measurement is MAP; b/c at the point the pulsatile pressure reach the maximum-amplitude.
- DBP is most inaccurate; b/c arterial pulsation does not disappear at DBP.
- It is inaccurate in noncompliance arteries (old Pts and peripheral aterial disease)
- lower than direct BP measurements
